      "title": "Our History",
      "text": "It all began with the idea of giving new life to wood that had already lived for centuries. We saw beauty in barn boards that preserved traces of time and decided to turn them into something more than just material — into the foundation for unique interiors.\n\nFrom a small workshop, we grew into a production facility that today is the only one in Ukraine manufacturing three-layer furniture panels from reclaimed oak and coniferous species. We combined craftsmanship with technology to create stable, ecological, and aesthetically refined solutions for designers, architects, and furniture makers.\n\nEvery panel is the result of careful selection, drying, gluing, and finishing. We don’t just work with wood — we preserve its history so it can live on in new spaces."
